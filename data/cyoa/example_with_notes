The drunk and the cow.						<- this is the title, and it's shown before the first section. Keep it to one line.
---											<- this denotes the start of a section.
{0}											<- this is the section identifier
You and some mates got drunk. You've wandered off and found a field.	<- section description. You can do multiple lines, they get put on one, though.
[5, 10]										<- 5 is how long to wait before voting begins, 10 is how long they get to vote. in seconds
<1*> Approach the field.					<- these are the options presented to the users. 1 is the section marker to move to, * makes it default
<1> Approach the field!						<- you can have more than one going to the same place.
---
{1}
You see a cow. There's some cowshit between you and it.
[5, 10]
<2*> Tip the cow.							<- users do not see the section markers as the options. they're numbered 1->N dynamically.
<3> Stare at the cow.
<4> Attempt to ride the cow.
---
{2}
You attempt to tip the cow. It falls over on you, crushing you. You are dead.
$END										<- this will say "The End." after 3 seconds. You don't need a [timer] if it is the end.
---
{3}
You stare at the cow. It charges you, pinning you against a nearby tree. You're mostly unharmed, but unable to escape.
[20]										<- the vote timer isn't required here
<5*>										<- no text accompanying the option and the * make this a forced section change.
---
{4}
You get a running start and attempt to jump up on the cow. You trip on the way and fall in a fresh pile of cow shit.
Inhaling sharply at the sudden impact, you snort up a good wad of it. You do not feel fine.
[20, 30]
<6*> Try to blow your nose.
<7> Inhale deeply again.
---
{5}
A bull eyes the rear of the cow pinning you, and mounts it.
The cow pinning you is being ravaged by a bull.
Slowly, the bull's efforts cause the cow's body to crush your own.
You done died under some bovine sex.
$END
---
{6}
You block one nostril and blow hard, discharging the dung at high velocity - and repeat the process for the other.
After struggling to your feet, you give up on messing with the cow and make your way home.
$END
---
{7}
You inhale deeply again, snorting down the dung and attempting to swallow. It blocks your throat and you suffocate then and there.
$END
